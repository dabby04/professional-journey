      <br />
      <p>
        When people ask why I chose Computer Science, my answer always comes
        back to curiosity and impact. My fascination with technology began in
        secondary school. Even without formal programming classes, I found
        myself exploring beyond assignments and experimenting with new tools in
        ICT. Watching how technology could solve real-world problems inspired me
        to pursue Computer Science, where creativity meets logic.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my journey, I’ve discovered that Computer Science is not just
        about code; it is about connection, innovation, and empowerment. From
        developing chatbots and automating processes to leading the AI Club and
        coordinating hands-on workshops in the Seamless Fashion Club, I have
        learned that leadership and collaboration are as important as technical
        skill. Each project, whether a line of code or a community event, has
        strengthened my ability to problem-solve, adapt, and mentor others.
      </p>

      <p>
        My experiences, including researching continuous authentication and
        building E-learning platforms and dynamic discussion forums, have
        strengthened my technical foundation in
        <b>Python, Java, Node.js, React, and SQL</b>, while also nurturing
        creativity and resilience. I love that Computer Science gives me the
        freedom to explore diverse fields and make meaningful change through
        innovation and learning. As I continue my studies and pursue an
        <b>Undergraduate Certificate in Education Studies</b>, I aim to bridge
        technology and education to inspire others and make a lasting impact.
